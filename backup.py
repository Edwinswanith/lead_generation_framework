Dear Indian Kanoon API Support Team,

I am the developer/administrator for the Legal Assistant backend service, currently hosted at:
https://legal-assistant-backend-18-92187086208.us-central1.run.app

We use the Indian Kanoon API to programmatically access and download case PDFs as part of our legal research workflow. After migrating our solution to a new cloud environment, we are facing persistent "403 Forbidden" errors when making API calls, which we believe may be related to IP blocking or automated IP filter policies.

For your reference, our Indian Kanoon API profile is registered under this email: edwinswanith006@gmail.com.

To resolve this, I kindly request that you whitelist the following public IP address(es) associated with our cloud deployment:
- https://legal-assistant-backend-18-92187086208.us-central1.run.app

This will enable our backend server to securely interact with the Indian Kanoon API, while complying with usage and rate limits as per your documentation.

If you require any further information for verification, please let me know.

Thank you for your support.

Best regards,  
Edwinswanith,
Bizzzup Upscalling company,
